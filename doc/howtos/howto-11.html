<h1>boomerang howto #11:<br>Using the ads plugin</h1>
<p>
The ads plugin was devised as a simple way to check wether an ad blocking
mechanism is in use and beacon the data back to the server
</p>

<p>
To achieve this you have to provide a url to an image that you konw is an ad
and you know it will be there for a long time. It tries to create the image
with the url you provide. If if succeeds the parameter <em>ads</em> is beaconed
back with the value of <em>1</em>, otherwise it is <em>0</em>
</p>

<pre>
BOOMR.init({
  beacon_url: "http://localhost:8000",
  ads: {
    ads_src: "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/misc/advertisement.gif"
  }
});
</pre>

<p>There is only one parameter necessary for configuration</p>
<dl>
<dt>ads_src</dt>
<dd>
<strong>[mandatory]</strong>
The url to the source image to use for the test
</dd>
</dl>

<p>One variable is added to the beacon
<dl>
<dt>ads</dt>
<dd>
It has a value of 1 is the test suceeded, meaning ads are working
or a value of 0 is ads are disabled, by an adblocker for example.
</dd>
</dl>
